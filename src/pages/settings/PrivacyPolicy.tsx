              Introduction
            </p>
            <p className="tw-text-xs tw-font-[400] tw-leading-[14.63px] tw-mb-4">
              We care about privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental
              right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the
              personal information of their employees and their users, who are
              often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this
              information very seriously. We therefore have a dedicated data
              privacy program with privacy by design at its heart. You can learn
              more about our data privacy program by visiting our Trust Center.
            </p>
            <p className="tw-text-xs tw-font-[400] tw-leading-[14.63px] tw-mb-4">
              Our business model is different from that of companies that
              collect your personal information to monetize such data. We
              collect and use personal information to allow us to provide our
              products and services to our clients and end users. In most cases,
              we do this at the direction of our clients. We do not and will not
              sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in
              the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger
              or acquisition. See Vendors, partners & other types of disclosures
              for more details on how we may disclose personal information in
              the context of changes to our business structure.
